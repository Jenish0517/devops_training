📘 Git Commands & Branching – Learning Summary
📖 About This Learning

Today, I learned the basics of Git commands and understood how branching works in version control. I practiced managing changes in a local repository and synchronizing them with a remote repository using GitHub.



🧠 Commands I Learned
🔹 git add

Stages changes from the working directory to the staging area before committing.

🔹 git commit

Saves staged changes with a meaningful message to the local repository.

🔹 git push

Uploads committed changes from the local repository to the remote repository (GitHub).

🔹 git pull

Fetches and merges the latest changes from the remote repository to the local repository.

🔹 git stash

Temporarily saves uncommitted changes without committing them.

🔹 git branch

Creates, lists, or deletes branches.




🌿 Git Branching

I learned:

What is a branch in Git
Why branching is used (feature development, bug fixes)
Creating a new branch
Switching between branches
Working independently on different branches

Example commands practiced:

git branch feature-branch
git checkout feature-branch
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch




🎯 Learning Outcome

Understood Git workflow (Working Directory → Staging → Commit → Remote)
Learned how branching helps in collaborative development
Gained confidence using Git through CLI
Improved understanding of version control concepts
