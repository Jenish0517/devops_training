📘 AWS VPC & EC2 Practice – Apache Web Server Setup
📖 About This Practice

As part of my AWS learning journey, I created a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and launched an EC2 instance inside it. On the EC2 instance, I installed and configured an Apache Web Server to host a simple web page.

This exercise helped me understand AWS networking basics and how web servers are deployed in the cloud.
